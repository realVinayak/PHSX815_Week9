<h1>Homework 9</h1>
Calculates the minimum of the function $sin(x)^2$. Since the function is periodic, 
and has infinitely many roots, the starting guess is chosen to be $3\frac{\pi}{4}$. 
This is done to make the plausible solution be $\pi$ instead of any of the other 
solutions. <br/>
To run the code, type `python3 driver.py`. Make sure you have `scipy` installed
on your local machine. <br/>
The code prints the solution found, the expected solution ($\pi$) and the error.
